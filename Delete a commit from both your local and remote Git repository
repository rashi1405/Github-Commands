# Delete a commit from both your local and remote Git repository, follow these steps carefully.

1. Delete a Commit Locally
If you want to remove the last commit from your local repository:

Option 1: Revert to the previous commit (safe way)

git reset --soft HEAD^

This command moves the HEAD pointer to the previous commit, but keeps your changes staged, so you can re-commit them if needed.

Alternatively, if you want to discard the changes entirely:

git reset --hard HEAD^

This will completely remove the last commit and its changes from the working directory and staging area.

Option 2: Removing a specific commit in the history (interactive way) If the commit is not the most recent one, you can use:

git rebase -i HEAD~n

Replace n with the number of commits you'd like to go back (e.g., HEAD~5 to edit the last 5 commits). This opens an editor where you can modify commits.

In the editor, change pick to drop next to the commit you want to remove, save, and close the editor.

2. Push the Changes to Remote (force-push)

Once you've removed the commit(s) locally, you'll need to force-push the updated history to the remote repository:

If you removed the most recent commit:

git push origin +branch-name --force

Replace branch-name with the branch you're working on, like main or master. The + before the branch name ensures that you're force-pushing and replacing the remote history.

If you deleted a commit through rebase, you can also force-push the changes:

git push --force
