1. Switch to the branch you want to rename:

  git checkout <old-branch-name>

Replace <old-branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to rename.

2. Rename the branch:

  git branch -m <new-branch-name>

. Verify the rename:

git branch

This will list all the local branches, showing the updated name.

4. Push the renamed branch to the remote (if needed): If the branch is tracked on the remote repository, push the renamed branch:

   git push origin -u <new-branch-name>


5. Delete the old branch on the remote (optional): If the branch exists on the remote and you no longer need the old name:

 git push origin --delete <old-branch-name>

 
By doing this, the branch will have a new name locally and (if pushed) on the remote as well.
